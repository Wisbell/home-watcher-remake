# <p align="center">Home Watcher Remake</p>

## Description

This is a remake of my Nashville Software School back-end project.  It allows a user to keep track of pictures generated by a Raspberry Pi computer.  The Raspberry Pi computer is connected to a motion sensor which triggers a camera.  A user can start/stop the camera if the Raspberry Pi computer is online and create incidents related to generated pictures.  The project allows for multiple users as well.
