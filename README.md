# <p align="center">Home Watcher Remake</p>

## Description

This is a remake of my Nashville Software School back-end project.  It allows a user to keep track of pictures generated by a Raspberry Pi computer.  The Raspberry Pi computer is connected to a motion sensor which triggers a camera.  A user can start/stop the camera if the Raspberry Pi computer is online and create incidents related to generated pictures.  The project allows for multiple users as well.

Note: It may take heroku a second to start up the server if it hasn't been visited recently.  You may have to log in twice in order for Heroku to wake up the back end API as well.  The Rapsberry Pi camera is usually only online when I am personally showing off or working on the project.  The project does contain a small example of an image/incident generated by the motion sensor/camera.
